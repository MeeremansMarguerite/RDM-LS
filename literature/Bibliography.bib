abstract = {Skin testing is a basic diagnostic procedure widely used to explore immediate-type reactions to allergen preparations in vivo. Despite their reliability, if standardized extracts are used, skin tests suffer from limited reproducibility due to difficulties in preparing consistently standardized extracts from natural raw material. Starting from allergen-encoding cDNAs, large amounts of highly pure allergens with a high batch-to-batch consistency satisfying the quality requirements of medicinal products manufactured by recombinant DNA technology can be produced. These reagents are expected to be qualitatively superior to the commercially available allergen preparations used for the in vitro and in vivo diagnosis of allergic conditions. In this article the current literature available on skin testing with such recombinant allergens (rAllergens) is reviewed and critically analyzed. To date many different rAllergens of various pollens, moulds, mites, bee venom, latex and celery have been used in skin testing in more than 1,600 allergic and control individuals. Skin prick tests as well as intradermal skin tests with rAllergens prove to be highly specific and safe. The diagnostic sensitivity of single rAllergens is generally lower than those obtained with allergen extracts, but can be considerably increased by using rAllergen panels covering the most important allergenic structures present in a given complex allergenic extract. Moreover, quantitative skin testing with single rAllergens allows interesting insights into correlations between the in vivo and in vitro sensitization to a given allergen. In conclusion, skin testing with rAllergens offers a highly specific and safe additional diagnostic tool to elucidate patient- and disease-specific sensitization patterns which will be needed for the development of patient-tailored immunotherapeutic treatments.

abstract = {Insect bite hypersensitivity (IBH) is an allergic dermatitis of the horse caused by bites of insects of the genus Culicoides and is currently the best characterized allergic disease of horses. This article reviews knowledge of the immunopathogenesis of IBH, with a particular focus on the causative allergens. Whereas so far hardly any research has been done on the role of antigen presenting cells in the pathogenesis of IBH, recent studies suggest that IBH is characterized by an imbalance between a T helper 2 (Th2) and regulatory T cell (T reg) immune response, as shown both locally in the skin and with stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Various studies have shown IBH to be associated with IgE-mediated reactions against salivary antigens from Culicoides spp. However, until recently, the causative allergens had not been characterized at the molecular level. A major advance has now been made, as 11 Culicoides salivary gland proteins have been identified as relevant allergens for IBH. Currently, there is no satisfactory treatment of IBH. Characterization of the main allergens for IBH and understanding what mechanisms induce a healthy or allergic immune response towards these allergens may help to develop new treatment strategies, such as immunotherapy. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {In horses, allergies have been characterized by clinical signs and/or intradermal (i.d.) allergen testing. Our aim was to find the first direct evidence that immunoglobulin E (IgE) mediates equine allergy. In addition, we tested the hypothesis that immediate skin reactions in horses can also be mediated by IgG. Anti-IgE affinity columns were used to purify IgE from serum of one healthy horse and three horses affected with summer eczema, an allergic dermatitis which is believed to be induced by Culicoides midges. A modified Prausnitz-K{\"{u}}stner experiment was performed in four clinical healthy horses by i.d. injection of the purified serum IgE antibodies. The following day, Culicoides allergen was injected at the same sites. Skin reactions were not observed in response to allergen alone, and in two horses after stimulation at any previous IgE injection site. However, the other two horses showed an immediate skin reaction at the previous injection sites of IgE obtained from allergic horses. In addition, purified monoclonal antibodies to various equine immunoglobulin isotypes were injected i.d. into six healthy horses. Immediate skin reactions were observed in response to anti-IgE (6/6 horses) and anti-IgG(T) injections (5/6 horses). The specificities of both antibodies for IgE and IgG(T), respectively, were confirmed by enzyme linked immunosorbent assays. The results provide the first direct evidence that IgE mediates classical Type-I allergy in horses and plays a major role in the pathogenesis of summer eczema. The data also suggest that IgG(T) can bind to skin mast cells and might contribute to clinical allergy. {\textcopyright} INRA, EDP Sciences, 2006.},

abstract = {SAMENVATTING Zomereczeem is een allergische reactie op specifieke antigenen in het speeksel van Culicoides-muggen of andere insecten. In deze studie werden omgevingsfactoren ge{\"{i}}dentificeerd die geassocieerd zijn met het voorkomen van zomereczeem bij Belgische warmbloedpaarden (BWP) in Vlaanderen (Belgi{\"{e}}). Daarvoor werden met behulp van een enqu{\^{e}}te 3409 gegevens over zomereczeem verzameld tijdens sportwedstrijden, BWP-prijskampen en via persoonlijk contact met grote fokkers (stoeterijbezoeken en telefoongesprekken). De paarden werden ingedeeld in "zomereczeempositief" of-negatief op basis van de informatie die door de eigenaars aangereikt werd. De gemiddelde prevalentie van zomereczeem bij BWP bedroeg 10{\%} in Vlaanderen. Zeventig procent van de zomerczeempositieve paarden werd behandeld met preventiemaat-regelen om de symptomen te onderdrukken en 38{\%} van de positieve paarden vertoonde geen symptomen op het moment dat de enqu{\^{e}}te werd afgenomen. Hierdoor was de gemiddelde prevalentie van merkbare symptomen slechts 6,2{\%}. De volgende risicofactoren voor het optreden van zomereczeem bij BWP werden ge{\"{i}}dentificeerd: leeftijd, de methode van datacollectie, de periode waarop de enqu{\^{e}}te werd afgenomen, de trainingsfrequentie en de vegetatie van de omliggende weiden. Daarenboven be{\"{i}}nvloedde het aantal paar-den per eigenaar eveneens de (gerapporteerde) prevalentie van zomereczeem.},
